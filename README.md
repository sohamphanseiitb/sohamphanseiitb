# Hello World!

I am a third year Undergraduate in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I am largely interested in System Dynamics, and Space Systems Engineering and Development. I work in the Mechanical subsystem of the [Student Satellite Program of IIT Bombay](http://iitbssp.ml/) since January 2020. Currently I am working on a 'Star Tracker based Attitude Determination System' in the domain of Structural Design and Analysis.
