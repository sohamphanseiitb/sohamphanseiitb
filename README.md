# Namaste World!

I am a first-year Graduate Student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. I completed my undergraduate studies in Aerospace Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). I am interested in Autonomous Systems and Robotics, Engineering Design, Systems Thinking, and Organization Theory in general. I was a part of the [Student Satellite Program of IIT Bombay](http://iitbssp.ml/) till 2022, where I led a team to design of a star tracker for nano-satellites. I am currently working at the [LATTICE](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/lattice/home) Lab under the guidance of Prof. Max Li on the optimal dispatch strategy for multi-agent drone systems for drone-based logistics.

#### AE759 : Systems Engineering Principles
##### Systems Engineering Analysis of Autonomous Surveillance System 
_Under guidance of [Prof. Hemendra Arya](https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/~arya/), Department of Aerospace Engineering_
   - Armed forces operating in the mountainous region near the Indo-China and Indo-Pakistan borders need to continuously patrol the borders for possible infiltration and             military activity by the enemy. This is currently executed by deploying personnel at critical locations. However, this arrangement falls short of round the clock                 surveillance and 100% coverage.  Hence, there is a need to design an automated system that can ensure near 100% coverage in the critical areas and operate all the time.
   - The project mission statement was : "To design and deploy an autonomous surveillance system for the Indian Army for operations near the Indo-China and Indo-Pakistan             Border". The project involved Systems Engineering Processes like *Business* or *Mission Analysis* Process, *Stakeholder requirements capture and analysis*, *System requirements definition, System hierarchy, Archirecture definition process, Design Definition Process, System Analysis process, Implementation process, Integration, Verification, Transition, Validation, Operation, Maintainance, Disposal etc., Aracadia, Capella implementation.

### Research Assistance at Department of Energy Science and Engineering
#### A System Dynamics based Approach for Modelling Energy Usage
_Under guidance of [Prof. Rangan Banerjee](https://www.ese.iitb.ac.in/~rb/#!/home), Department of Energy Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay_
* Worked on a Research Project titled "*A System Dynamics approach for Modelling Energy Usage*". The objective was to construct a systems theory-based methodology to analyse energy usage in both static and dynamic domains. *Interface Control Document*-based structures, *Process Flow Diagrams* and *Stock and Flow Diagrams* were used to depict the Static Energy Balance of selected Industries in the year 2017. *Causal Loop Diagrams*, *Time series Graphs* were utilised to depict the Dynamic Modelling of Energy Usage. An example of Population Dynamics of IIT Bombay Campus and Energy Usage derived from that was presented. It was conceived with discrete-time equations and some assumptions
* Awarded [**Undergraduate Research Award 01**](https://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/urop.jsp) for developing the framework

_Under guidance of [Prof. Amuthan Ramabathiran](https://amuthan.github.io/webpage/), Department of Aerospace Engineering, IIT Bombay_
* Implemented numerical techniques like Finite Difference Method, Backward and Forward Euler Methods in Python, and FEM (Galerkin Approximation) for ODE in Python
* Implemented numerical solutions of PDEs governing deflection of membrane with point load, 2D linear elastic analysis of a cantilever beam, time-dependent heat equations with the Finite Element Method in FEniCS
* Explored Calculus of Variations, Functional Optimization with Euler-Lagrange equations and applied it to Shape and Topology Optimisation problems like compliance minimisation of a cantilever beam
<!---* Working on a learning project titled "*Topology Optimization and Finite Element Methods in FEniCS*". It involves simulating PDEs on a FEM solver based on Python. It also involves shape and topology optimization problems. Check the work [here](https://github.com/sohamphanseiitb/Topology-Optimization-of-Hierarchial-Structures)--->

## General Interests
Apart from my studies in my free time I like to read about Indian Mythology, Astronomy and I am a great fan of [Devdutt Pattnaik](https://devdutt.com/). I have read both of his excellent commentaries on Mahabharata and the Ramayana namely '_Jaya: An illustriuos retelling of the Mahabharata_' and '_Sita: An illustriuos retelling of the Ramayana_'. Currently I am reading his commentary _'My Gita'_ on _'Bhagvadgeeta'_. 

This liking was developed because of a slight reading of few initials of the book '_Bhagavadgeeta: As it is'_ by [H.H. Sri A.C Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._C._Bhaktivedanta_Swami_Prabhupada).

I also play guitar and harmonium in my free time. Other that that, I have read and studied about the _"Ancient Astronaut theory"_ propounded by Erick Von Daniken, author of _'Chariots of the Gods?'_. Regarding astronomy I try to read up whenever I am free and have gone through '_A Brief History of Time'_ by _'Dr. Prof. Stephen Hawking'_ which is a very nice book based on fundamentals of space, time etc.
