# Hello World!

I am a third year Undergraduate in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I am largely interested in System Dynamics, and Space Systems Engineering and Development. I work in the Mechanical subsystem of the [Student Satellite Program of IIT Bombay](http://iitbssp.ml/) since January 2020. Currently I am working on a 'Star Tracker based Attitude Determination System' in the domain of Structural Design and Analysis. 

In my tenure at IIT Bombay I have gained exposure in some of the topics via courses like : 
- Electives
  - SC639 : Mathematical Structures for Control
  - AE759 : Systems Engineering Principles
- Core Courses
  - AE240 : Spaceflight Mechanics
  - AE234 : Aircraft Propulsion
  - AE236 : Gas Dynamics
  - AE238 : Aerospace Structural Mechanics
  - 

Some short and long projects which I have done are as below
* AE234 : Aircraft Propulsion
  - What PRICE Speed? : A detailed review/verification of the results of the seminal paper _What PRICE Speed?_
